import { useFilters } from 'react-use-filters'

interface Filters {
  filtersGroup: string[]
}

function App() {
  // For example we will use react-state for storing filters
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<Filters>({ filtersGroup: []})

  const { 
    setFilter, 
    state: { count, isReady }, 
    onSubmit 
  } = useFilters<Filters>({ 
    defaultValues: filters, 
    submitFn: ({ state }) => setFilters(state)
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {['Filter1', 'Filter2', 'Filter3'].map((filter) => {
          return (
            <button
              onClick={() => setFilter('filtersGroup', filter)}
              key={filter}
            >
              {filter}
            </button>
          )
        })}
      </div>
      <button disabled={!isReady} onClick={onSubmit}>
